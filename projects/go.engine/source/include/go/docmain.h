    \section General
    Go is a small engine framework which I (Gokhan Ozdogan) developed for the sole purpose
    of experimenting with the DirectX 11 API and using <a href="http://www.intel.com/">Intel</a>'s
    <a href="http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-vtune-amplifier-xe/">VTune</a>.\n
    Most of the internals are designed to work with a 32-bit Windows version only (for convenience).\n
    The term "thread-safe" is used as a synonym for MRMW-safety (context-free).
